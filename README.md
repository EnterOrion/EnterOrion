### Hello and welcome! ðŸ˜€

âž¡ My name is Orion and I'm a full stack web developer with a focus on the MERN stack. I also like to use Firebase for the backend as well. Currently, I'm working on a social media application that connects with Spotify. <br/>

ðŸ”¥ I'm a determined programmer that strives to make websites that feature a clean design, responsiveness, and that are accessible for all.   <br/>

ðŸ’» The more that I learn about programming, the greater appreciation I have for it. I love the feeling I get from building something. Every day, it teaches me how to be a more organized and better thinker.
